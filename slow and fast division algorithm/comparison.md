# Comparison of Division Algorithms

| Algorithm                  | Time Complexity | Iterations Required |
|----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Restoring Division         | O(n)            | n                   |
| Non-Restoring Division     | O(n)            | n                   |
| SRT Division               | O(log n)        | log n               |
| Newton-Raphson Division    | O(log n)        | log n               |

### Key Points
- **Restoring and Non-Restoring**: Simple but slow; good for educational purposes.
- **SRT and Newton-Raphson**: Fast and efficient, suitable for high-performance applications.
